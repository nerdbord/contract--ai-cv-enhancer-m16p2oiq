Contract: AI CV Enhancer
Enhance and personalize your CV for specific job offers using AI.
Welcome to the AI CV Enhancer Project!

In this project, you will create an application that takes an existing CV, improves it, and allows the user to download the enhanced version. Additionally, the app will have a feature to adjust the CV to match a specific job offer by analyzing the job offer URL. This will enable users to send personalized CVs tailored to the job they are applying for.

Your goal is to build a user-friendly application that leverages AI to help users create standout CVs. The project will be divided into manageable tasks, guiding you through the process of building and deploying the application.

Get ready to enhance your skills and create something truly impactful. Let's get started!

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
